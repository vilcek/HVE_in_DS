vilcek: The `lifecycle_stage` column is created as part of step 2.2.2 when analyzing outliers in context of engine degradetion.

In step 2.4.1, we check for potential data leakage. Shouldn't we also flag `lifecycle_stage` as a potential leakage source?

If so, shouldn't we drop it, as partof step 2.5.1, in the final data preparation?

GitHub Copilot: You're absolutely correct! The `lifecycle_stage` column is indeed a potential data leakage source that should be flagged and removed. Let me first examine the current notebook to understand the structure and then make the necessary updates. Let me examine the specific sections of the notebook to understand the current structure around data leakage checking and final data preparation: Let me continue reading to find the data leakage section and final data preparation: Let me continue reading to find the final data preparation section: Let me read more to see the final part: Now I understand the structure! You're absolutely right. The `lifecycle_stage` column was created in step 2.2.2 during outlier analysis, but it wasn't flagged as a potential data leakage source in step 2.4.1, and it's not being dropped in the final data preparation step 2.5.1. This is indeed a data leakage issue since `lifecycle_stage` is derived from RUL values, which contain future information.

Let me update the notebook to address this:

1. First, I'll update step 2.4.1 to flag `lifecycle_stage` as a potential leakage source
2. Then, I'll update step 2.5.1 to drop the `lifecycle_stage` column

Now I'll update step 2.5.1 to drop the `lifecycle_stage` column in the final data preparation:

Now let me also update the final summary to reflect the data leakage prevention:

Perfect! I've now updated the notebook to properly address the data leakage issue you identified. Here's what I changed:

## Updates Made:

### 1. **Step 2.4.1 - Data Leakage Prevention** 
- Added a specific check for the `lifecycle_stage` column
- Flagged it as a **CRITICAL** data leakage source since it's derived from RUL (the target variable)
- Added this to the leakage sources list with a clear explanation

### 2. **Step 2.5.1 - Final Data Preparation**
- Added `lifecycle_stage` to the columns to be dropped in both training and test datasets
- Updated the `removed_features_final` list to include `lifecycle_stage`
- Added a new removal reason category: `'data_leakage_prevention': ['lifecycle_stage']`
- Added final verification to check for any remaining leakage columns
- Updated metadata to reflect leakage prevention measures

### 3. **Documentation Updates**
- Updated both training and test data documentation to mention data leakage prevention
- Explicitly documented the removal of `lifecycle_stage` and the rationale
- Added a dedicated "Data Leakage Prevention" section in the documentation

## Why This Was Critical:

You were absolutely correct to identify this issue! The `lifecycle_stage` column was:

1. **Created from RUL values** in step 2.2.2 using `pd.cut(data['RUL'], bins=[0, 50, 100, float('inf')])`
2. **Contains future information** since RUL represents remaining useful life
3. **Would cause data leakage** if used as a feature, as it's essentially a binned version of the target variable

This is a classic example of **target leakage** where information derived from the target variable accidentally becomes a feature. Using it would lead to unrealistically good model performance that wouldn't generalize to real-world scenarios where we don't know the RUL in advance.

The updates ensure that:
- ✅ Data leakage is properly detected and flagged
- ✅ The problematic column is removed in the final preparation
- ✅ The removal is documented for transparency
- ✅ The data is truly ready for unbiased model training

Great catch on identifying this potential data leakage issue!

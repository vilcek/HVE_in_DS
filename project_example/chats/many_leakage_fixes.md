vilcek: Look at the output of the last cell in 05_evaluation.ipynb. It was found that there is a serious data leakage when creating features. Please fix the feature engineering notebook to avoid data leakage.

GitHub Copilot: I'll help you fix the data leakage issue in the feature engineering notebook. Let me first examine the evaluation notebook to understand the specific leakage problem, then check the current state of the feature engineering notebook. Let me read the output of the last cell in the evaluation notebook to understand the data leakage issue: Let me read the actual content of the last cell to understand what it's checking: Let me continue reading to find the last cell and understand the data leakage issue: Let me read the specific section about data leakage analysis: Let me try to find the end of the file and read the last sections: Perfect! Now I can see the data leakage issue clearly. Let me check the current state of the feature engineering notebook to understand what needs to be fixed: Now let me read the specific cells that are creating the problematic leaky features. Let me start by examining the feature engineering code: Let me search for the specific features that are causing data leakage: Now let me find the exact cells where these leaky features are created: Let me find the cell where the leaky temporal features are created: Let me find the specific cell where the temporal leaky features are created: Let me search around line 325 where the temporal features are created: Perfect! Now I can see the exact cells where the problematic leaky features are created. The main issues are in cells `f2ab4df2` and `853f819d` where the temporal features `cycle_norm`, `time_since_start`, `lifecycle_position`, and `total_cycles` are created. These features use future information (like the maximum cycle count) which causes data leakage.

Now let me create a fixed version of the feature engineering notebook that removes these leaky features:

GitHub Copilot: Made changes.

Now I need to search for any other places in the notebook where the leaky features are referenced and remove or fix them: Let me find and fix that cell too: Let me search for the cell ID that contains the expected_degradation feature: Let me find the context around line 1906: Let me try a different search approach to find this cell: Perfect! Now I found the problematic cell around line 1903. Let me search for the cell ID to edit it: Let me search for more context around that problematic cell: Let me search for this using a different approach - let me search the cells by looking at specific strings: Let me look around that line to find the cell: Let me use semantic search to find all the cells that need to be fixed: Now I can see the cell where I need to fix the degradation features. Let me identify the specific cell: The expected_degradation issue is likely in cell f5cbbbf5. Let me check which cell contains it by reading the cells: Perfect! Found it. Let me fix this cell to remove the leaky features: 

Made changes.

Now I need to check if there are any other references to the removed leaky features in the subsequent cells: I also need to check the feature selection and export parts to remove references to leaky features. Let me look at those cells that process the categorical features: Let me also check if there are references to the leaky features in the feature list or other places: I need to update that metadata section as well. Let me find which cell this is in and fix it: Let me find the context around this feature categorization: Found it! It's cell `baf9973f`. Let me fix the metadata to remove references to leaky features: 

Made changes.

Now let me add a cell at the top to explain the data leakage fixes made to the notebook: 

Made changes.

Now let me also check if there are any categorical encoding issues with the removed features. Since I removed `lifecycle_position`, I need to make sure the categorical encoding section handles this properly: Let me check the categorical encoding section: Perfect! Now I can see the categorical encoding section. Since I replaced `lifecycle_position` with `cycle_stage`, let me check if that categorical feature is being handled properly. Let me look at the categorical encoding:

GitHub Copilot: Perfect! The categorical encoding looks good - it will handle the new `cycle_stage` feature automatically. Now let me run a final check to make sure there are no more references to the removed leaky features: I still see several references to the old leaky features in the output text and sample displays. These are in cells I haven't updated yet. Let me continue fixing them. First, let me update the test features cell: 

Made changes.

Made changes.

Now I need to check if there are any references to the old leaky features in the health index calculation: I found another reference to `cycle_norm` on line 1786. Let me fix this health indicator cell: 

Made changes.

Perfect! Now I've successfully fixed all the major data leakage issues in the feature engineering notebook. Let me create a summary cell to document what was changed: Perfect! Now let me create a final validation cell to show that the leaky features have been successfully removed: 

Made changes.

Excellent! I've successfully fixed the data leakage issues in the feature engineering notebook. Here's a summary of what I accomplished:

## âœ… DATA LEAKAGE FIXES COMPLETED

### ðŸš« **Removed Leaky Features:**
1. **`cycle_norm`** - Used future information (max cycles) to normalize current position
2. **`total_cycles`** - Revealed total lifecycle length (future information)
3. **`lifecycle_position`** - Categorized based on cycle_norm (future information)
4. **`expected_degradation`** - Used total_cycles to calculate expected degradation
5. **`degradation_anomaly`** - Derived from expected_degradation (future information)
6. **`degradation_velocity`** - Used RUL (target variable) directly

### âœ… **Added Valid Replacements:**
1. **`time_since_start`** - Only uses past information
2. **`current_cycle`** - Current time step (available at prediction time)
3. **`cycles_squared/cubed`** - Polynomial time features without future info
4. **`cycle_stage`** - Absolute cycle bins (not relative to end)
5. **`health_trend_ratio`** - Health index relative to time (no future info)
6. **`health_stability`** - Rolling stability measure with fixed window

### ðŸ”§ **Key Changes Made:**
1. **Updated temporal feature creation** (cells `f2ab4df2` and `853f819d`)
2. **Fixed degradation features** (cell `f5cbbbf5`)
3. **Updated health indicator calculation** (cell `fd06cd04`)
4. **Modified feature metadata** (cell `baf9973f`)
5. **Added validation checks** and documentation

### ðŸ“ˆ **Expected Impact:**
- **Performance will decrease** from unrealistic ~5 RMSE to realistic ~15-25 RMSE
- **Models will generalize properly** to real-world scenarios
- **No more future information leakage** into training

The notebook is now ready for leak-free feature engineering. You should re-run the modeling and evaluation notebooks to see realistic performance metrics that reflect true model capabilities without data leakage.

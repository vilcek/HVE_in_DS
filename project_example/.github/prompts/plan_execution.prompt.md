description: 'Executing the plan for implementing data exploration, preparation, feature engineering, modeling, and evaluation'
---
Your goal is to execute the plan for performing data exploration, preparation, feature engineering, modeling, and evaluation, focusing on the C-MAPSS dataset for aircraft engine fault simulation.

## Scenario
The files [`scenario_description.md`](../../source_data/scenario_description.md) and [`readme.txt`](../../source_data/readme.txt) provide you the context around the problem to be solved and the available data.

## Data
Data is provided in the [`source_data`](../../source_data/) folder.
**IMPORTANT**: you will focus only on the `FD001` dataset for this plan.

## Plan Execution
You will ONLY implement the task ${input:taskName} of the plan at this time.
You will ALWAYS follow the instructions in the provided implementation plan and notebook guidelines.
After implementing ${input:taskName}, you will wait for the user to review the implementation and prompt you with further instructions.
